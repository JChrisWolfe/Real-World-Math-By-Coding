# Real-World-Math-By-Coding
### Author: @JChrisWolfe
=============================

## Project Description: 
This github pages website is to informally teach 
Every Day but approachable mathematics though programming
such as: Javascipt, Python, and other programming languages.
This is inspired by courses like Lynda.com, 
Youtube Channel "Coding Math" and other inspirations.

This is a community-based project for beginners and intermediate
programmers who want to apply real-life math problems into code.

This website will not teach individuals how to code but may
refer to websites that will give the individuals information
on what they should at least know to understand the topic.

The only exception known by author @JChrisWolfe on 2/22/2019
is the "R" programming language.

This website will teach using programming languages

## Scope:
- Website is constructed with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript
- Website is created with Usability and Disability in mind.
    - Disabilty includes: Cognitive, Limited Visual and Hearing.
- Website is created Mobile-first and then Response Design.
    - (Optional) Includes e-reader books e.g. Amazon Kindle, NOOK Books, etc.
- Source Codes are constructed with as little Modules or Libraries as possible.
- Programming languages and required programs to use the programming languages are free and open source.
    - IF the closed source languages are popular enough then they maybe included in
    tutorials with the author's permission
- Source Codes are beginner friendly.
- Source Codes are comment to explain how each line or lines of code works.
- Each Math code example are run on their own files and are not concatinated together or all-in-one.

## Out-of-Scope:
- For Javascript, no frameworks are used.
- No HTML or CSS Frameworks used.
- The website will not teach individuals how to program,
however individuals may refer and teach the basics of IDEs, APIs, 
Text Editors, Operating Systems, and compliers used plus extentions
used for source code and topics if it's required for the topic 
and examples.
